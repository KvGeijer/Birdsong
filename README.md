# What birdsong is that?
This was a project where we trained a neural network to recognize bird species from their bird song. This was done for 3 and 6 different bird species and two different methods of selecting training data were tested. We also simulated data to train our network on.

To train the AI on the real bird songs you need to first run the scripts CreateSpectros and CreateSyllables to set up the input data. Then the longEval files can be run.

This project was a collaboration between Kåre von Geijer, Oskar Åström, Emil Sandelin, Maja Gajić.
